<h3>Kids LOVE Breakfast and Lunch Bunch!</h3>
<p>Extended Day Care is a less structured, but very enjoyable, time of day for your child.  It is designed for your convenience.  You may leave your child occasionally, or every day as it suits your schedule.  The rates are broken down into 5 minute intervals so you are only charged for the amount of time your child is with us.  We will bill you at the end of the month for the time your child stayed.  Any child enrolled at United Methodist Nursery School is welcome to come to Lunch Bunch even on the days he or she is not at school.  We ask that you inform the school a day ahead, or call by 9:30am to ensure we have enough teachers on hand to watch all of the children.</p>

<h3>Breakfast Bunch</h3>
<p>We offer extended day care in the mornings from 7:00-8:45am.  The school does not provide breakfast, but will provide milk and/or juice until 8:15am.  If you are bringing cereal or other breakfast foods, please only bring a one day supply.  We do not have room for extra food storage.</p>

<h3>Lunch Bunch</h3>
<p>The children who stay for afternoon care are part of Lunch Bunch.  For a child to stay for Lunch Bunch, they must bring a lunch from home or purchase pizza or hot dogs when they are offered.  Lunches cost $3.00 per day.  We ask that you not include candy, gum, or sodas in the lunch.  We have the children eat their "grow foods" (nutritional foods) in their lunches before they can eat the rest, so please put nutritional foods that they will enjoy.  Please do not expect the day care attendant to microwave food, peel oranges, etc.</p>
<br />

<div class="bold">Reminder: </div><p>Because we are a half-day program, we are not required to make the children have a two hour nap.  If you feel that your child requires a nap we will make every effort to have him or her take one.</p>
